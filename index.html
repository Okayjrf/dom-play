          <p>SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.</p>
          <p>Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA</p>
          <p><span data-actor="LAERTES">LAERTES: My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:<br>
            And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>
            And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br>
            But let me hear from you.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="OPHELIA">OPHELIA: Do you doubt that?</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="LAERTES">LAERTES: For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br>
            Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br>
            A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>
            Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>
            The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="OPHELIA">OPHELIA: No more but so?</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="LAERTES">LAERTES: Think it no more;<br>
            For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br>
            In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br>
            The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
            Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
            And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
            The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br>
            His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br>
            For he himself is subject to his birth:<br>
            He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
            Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br>
            The safety and health of this whole state;<br>
            And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br>
            Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
            Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>
            It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
            As he in his particular act and place<br>
            May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
            Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
            Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br>
            If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
            Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br>
            To his unmaster'd importunity.<br>
            Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
            And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
            Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
            The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br>
            If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br>
            Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:<br>
            The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br>
            Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br>
            And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>
            Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
            Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br>
            Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="OPHELIA">OPHELIA: I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br>
            As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>
            Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>
            Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br>
            Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,<br>
            Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>
            And recks not his own rede.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="LAERTES">LAERTES: O, fear me not.<br>
            I stay too long: but here my father comes.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="LORD-POLONIUS">Enter POLONIUS<br>A double blessing is a double grace,<br>
            Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</span></p>
          <p><span data-actor="LORD-POLONIUS">LORD POLONIUS: Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
            The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
            And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!<br>
            And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
            See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
            Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br>
            Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
            Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
            Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
            But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
            Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware<br>
            Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br>
            Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
            Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>
            Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
            Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
            But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
            For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
            And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
            Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br>
            Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
            For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
            And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
            This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br>
            And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
            Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
            Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="LAERTES">LAERTES: Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</span></p>
